    question: "How much does a tattoo cost?",
    answer:
      "Our shop minimum is $100, our hourly rate ranges from $150 to $200 (depending on the artist). That said, the price of a tattoo is often dependent on the design/size/placement of the tattoo. You are always welcome to come in and chat with anyone here for a price quote for what you are looking for, as price quotes over the phone are rather hard.",
