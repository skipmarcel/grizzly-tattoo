      "Laura Graham is hands down, Portland's best tattoo artist! She is SO talented, and SO creative! We have only finished half of my piece and I am so blown away and satisfied with her work already!! She is an extremely warm person, and if you sit for hours, it will feel like time flies by because she's so accommodating and friendly! I highly recommend her and the shop.",

  //     "Cannot recommend Grizzly Tattoo enough. Tyler did such a wonderful job on my first tattoo, that I asked if he would do my second. I provided a rough idea of the design I was looking for in American traditional tattoo style, and he prepared a fantastic sketch and worked so patiently with me to get it exactly as I imagined it. He did amazing work in all aspects, checking in regularly to make sure I was doing okay, doing very small detail work on the parts that called for it, and shading the tattoo so it came to life even with the simple color scheme I chose. Lastly, the shop itself is wonderful, welcoming, and extremely clean.",
